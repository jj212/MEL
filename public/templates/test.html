The audiences and their information needs are defined in section 2.3 and the KEQs are detailed in Section 3.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c2 c10">We are also informed by a number of principles laid down in the program design and further developed with the YFBP team at the evaluation inception meeting in July 2019.
